\section{Display}
There also exists an integrated display solution, called the OSGView (OpenSceneGraph View). Currently it is experimental, and still under heavy development. For this reasons, it is not released as source code, but can be downloaded as an AppImage as binary component only. Please note that the display functionality is described in the later chapter OSG View (in section \nameref{sec:osgview}).\\\\

The following features currently exist:

\begin{itemize}  
\item Usage of data based on the highly flexible ATSDB framework
\item High-performance display based on OpenSceneGraph
\item Customizable map/terrain display based on osgEarth
\item Customizable display of Database Objects
\item Highlighting and labeling
\item Relatively low memory footprint (e.g. 17 million target reports in ~6 GB RAM)
\end{itemize}

\section{General Aspects}
ATSDB is a highly specialized surveillance data processing framework, with a strong focus on high-performance and a low memory footprint,  to process massive quantities of data. Surveillance data is fetched from a database (limited by a filter system), then processed and displayed using so-called Views (visualization of aspects of the result set).\\\\

As storage medium, a database is used.  Different database systems are supported, and a flexible read-out system allows for easy adaptation to different database schemas.  Data in such a database has to be generated in a previous, separate process.  One method would be to use EUROCONTROLS SASS-C  Verif V7/8 framework.\\

When such a previously generated database is opened for the first time, some post-processing is performed, to ease usage and to increase startup speed.  When data is loaded using a database query, a filter configuration may restrict the data leading to a result set.  Such a result set can be analyzed using Views, e.g. the Listbox view.\\

Each View defines which parts of the database are required to fulfill its purpose, and only such parts are loaded.  During a loading process from the database, subsets of the query result are immediately added to the current result set and all views are updated.
